# Changelog

All notable changes to FluidTouch will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Build-Time Factory Defaults** - New optional `hardware_defaults.ini` lets you compile WiFi credentials and the FluidNC address into the firmware as first-boot defaults: on a fresh install machine slot 0 is created automatically from these values, and the "Add Machine" dialog is pre-filled with them. Requires both `ssid` and `url` in the `[machine]` section; leave them empty to keep the previous behavior. Applied only once per install (re-applied after Clear All Settings), and SD-card settings auto-import still takes priority.

## [1.0.5] - 2026-04-24

### Added

- **Probe / Limit Switch Indicators** - Real-time pin status indicators on Control tabs and Status tab
  - Probe indicator on **Control → Probe** and on the Status tab
  - Limit-switch indicators (per axis) on **Control → Actions** and on the Status tab
  - Triggered indicators remain visible for 500ms so brief activations are easy to see
- **Terminal History** - Terminal tab now retains command history; recall previous commands for re-sending
- **FluidNC Version on About Tab** - Settings → About now displays the connected FluidNC controller's firmware version
- **M7 + M8 Coolant Display** - Status tab correctly shows both flood (M8) and mist (M7) coolant when active simultaneously

### Changed

- **A-Axis Setting is Per-Machine** - A-axis enable/disable is now stored per machine instead of as a global setting, allowing mixed 3-axis and 4-axis machine configurations
- **LVGL 9.5.0** - Updated UI library from 9.4.x to 9.5.0
- **LovyanGFX 1.2.19** - Updated display driver
- **ArduinoJson 7.4.3** - Updated JSON library
- **ESP32 Platform Branch** - Switched to the `Arduino/IDF53_gcc15` branch of the Jason2866 ESP32 platform after the previous `Arduino/IDF53` branch was removed/renamed upstream

### Fixed

- **Build Compatibility** - Resolved build break caused by the LovyanGFX update

## [1.0.4] - 2026-03-23

### Added

- **A-Axis Support** - Optional 4th-axis support for rotary and A-axis machines (#34)
  - Enable/disable via **Settings → General → Enable A-Axis** (takes effect after restart)
  - A-axis position display in status bar and Status tab (orange color)
  - A-axis jog section in **Control → Jog** tab (mirrors Z-axis layout with its own step buttons)
  - Z/A toggle on the right slider in **Control → Joystick** tab when A-axis is enabled
  - **Zero A** button in **Control → Actions** when A-axis is enabled
  - A-axis max feed rate and step size configuration in **Settings → Jog**
- **Configurable Jog Steps** - Per-machine jog step button values now configurable in **Settings → Jog**
  - XY, Z, and A-axis step lists are fully customizable (comma-separated values)
  - Changes saved per machine

### Fixed

- **File List Out of Memory** - Resolved crash when browsing directories with large numbers of files (#35)
- **Message Display Filtering** - Status bar and Status tab now only show informational and error messages, reducing noise from status report data
- **Wakeup Touch Suppression** - First touch input after wake from deep sleep or display-off state no longer triggers unintended UI actions

### Changed

- **Serial Input Forwarding** - Commands entered in a serial terminal (e.g., Arduino IDE Serial Monitor at 115200 baud) are now forwarded to FluidNC for debugging convenience

## [1.0.3] - 2026-02-10

### Added

- **Advance Hardware v1.2 Support** - Added support for Elecrow CrowPanel 7" Advance v1.2 displays (⚠️ untested) (#11)
  - Note: v1.2 requires same DIP switch configuration as v1.3 (S0 and S1 both set to position 1)
- **mDNS Hostname Resolution** - Connect to FluidNC by hostname (e.g., `fluidnc.local`) instead of IP address (#26)
- **Upload Directory Auto-Creation** - Automatically creates upload directory if it doesn't exist when uploading files from Display SD
- **Open Upload Folder Button** - Quick access button to open the uploaded files folder on FluidNC
- **WCS Display Enhancements** - Improved Work Coordinate System labeling and lock status indicators

### Fixed

- **Display Flicker** - Eliminated screen flicker by migrating to ESP-IDF 5.3 and optimizing display timing parameters
- **Basic Hardware Touch Response** - Improved touch sensitivity and reliability on Basic hardware variant (#21, #23)
- **Probe After WCS Confirmation** - Fixed probe operations failing after confirming Work Coordinate System updates
- **Web Installer Caching** - Prevented browser caching of versions.json to ensure latest version list is always displayed

## [1.0.2] - 2026-01-24

### Changed

- **Status Tab Updates**
  - **Pause/Resume and Stop Buttons** - Pause/Resume/Stop from status tab (#13)
  - **Position Update on Status Tab** - Click positions on status tab to update (#14)
  - **WCS Update on Status Tab** - Click work position values to update Work Coordinate System (#15)
- **Settings Updates**
  - **Display Rotation Support** - Can now rotate display 180 degrees via Settings → General (#12)
- **Web Installer Version Selection** - Dropdown to select from multiple firmware versions including preview builds

### Fixed

- **File Upload with Spaces** - Fixed handling of filenames containing spaces in upload operations

## [1.0.1] - 2025-12-04

### Fixed

- **Touch Screen Deep Sleep Bug** - Fixed touch screen not working after deep sleep wake on Basic hardware
- **Boot Display Flash** - Fixed garbled screen flash on startup

### Changed

- **Documentation Updates** - Product links now use affiliate codes to help support development
- **Hardware Recommendation** - Advance display model now marked as recommended (superior IPS display, optional battery case)
